"First attemp" version. Lot of options still to develop.
This is a tb6612fng DC motor driver library. Make sure you are using ONLY motor A.
Double motor controller is an option not available yet, but it will be in a "near" future.
Documentation nor available yet.
Thankfully, this will take me less than 30 minutes to do :D (I hope)
